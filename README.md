# Online_Shopping_Prototype_TurboCPP_Class-12th-Project
An online shopping prototype made using filestream classes in TurboC++ to sign up, login, order, buy, or add saved products to cart.
The project allows the user to sign up into the software, saving all the data in a Binary file
which can be later accessed for Logging In. The Binary file saves all the details of the customer, such as address, phone number, name, credentials.
The customer can also buy, add to cart and access later, or delete products added to cart.
The products being displayed are loaded from another binary file created only to save products with their name and ID.
